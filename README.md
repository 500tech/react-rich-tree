# React Tree

## A full featured tree component for React
We've built so many projects that required a tree component, and could never find a library that supported all features.
And building your own tree component is not an easy task.

So, we decided to build one for React, with all the features you can think of:
* Simple to use
* Well Documented
* Customizable & Extensible (override field names, custom templates, etc...)
* Keyboard navigation
* Async data
* Drag & Drop
* Select & Multiselect
* Filtering
* Virtual Scrolling
* Save & restore tree state
* Event callbacks
* API for accessing & altering the tree state
* Easily styled (comes with very minimal styling)

## Getting started

## What's next
We would always love to hear suggestions for features & improvements - just open an issue.

Some things on our mind down the road:
* Context menu
* Checkbox & master checkbox support
* Add more tests
* Add more examples

## Contributing
Coming soon

Please check the issues / project before starting to work on a feature / bug to make sure it's not already in progress.
